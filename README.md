# Web Development Project 3 - *MatrixMind*

Submitted by: **David Salas C.**

This web app: **This web app is a continuation of Characterization of Invertible Matrices. In this new version I implemented a feature to allow users to guess the answer of the flashcard. It indicates if the answer is right or wrong by chaging the color of the input box. If the answer is seen it disables the input and the button, until switching to the next card.**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app. I struggled with getting the button and input to disable when answer is seen, turns out I misspled the name of the variable in the App.jsx so it wasn't recognizing it the guessForms.jsx. That was the only issue after I figured that out everything worked fine.
